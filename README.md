This Projcect is apart of Software Engineering Course at Faculty of Electronic Engineering (FEE)
You'd better run this project on intellij , it's better as a platform for coding and creating GUIs. You also need to install this program "Scene builder"
To run this code properly, you need to add this library : jfoenix.jar 
This can be done as following: file-> project structure -> modules -> Dependencies -> click '+' in the upper right of the window -> choose the file "jfoenix.jar"
In this branch i created 2 GUIs through which you can deal with part of the data base. 
My work in this branch is over two tabs in the home page -> employee tab and vendor tab. 
For each tab we create four GUIs , each one is assigned to a button.
